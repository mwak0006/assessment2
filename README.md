# Assessment 2

Our project, conducted as part of an assessment at Monash University, analyses the World Development Indicators datas. The dataset is sourced from the World Bank and can be accessed here https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators#

The project directory includes a data folder containing a script to clean the data, the original dataset, and the cleaned dataset in a CSV file. The main analysis is presented in the assessment2.rmd file, and the final HTML output can be found in assessment2.html.
